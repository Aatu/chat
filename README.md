# Chat assignement for a job application

This is a demo project for a job application. This was made in one day. Do not expect the quality and scope to reflect more than one day worth of work.

## Technologies used

- Vite with react typescript template to bootstrap the project
- Styling with styled components as a personal preference
- Yarn to manage deps
- Polished for some minor visual fancyness
- Dayjs to format timestamps

## Running

1. `yarn` to install dependencies
1. `yarn dev` to start
